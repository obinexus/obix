# Decision Record: Adoption of Automaton State Minimization

## Date: 2025-03-04

## Status: Accepted

## Context
Modern web applications face significant performance challenges when handling large datasets and complex state transitions. Traditional approaches relying on virtual DOM diffing become increasingly inefficient as application complexity grows.

## Decision
We will adopt and implement Automaton State Minimization techniques to model UI components as finite state machines and optimize their state transitions. This approach will be the core technology of the OBIX library.

## Consequences
- Significant performance improvements for complex applications
- Reduced memory footprint
- More predictable performance characteristics
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with automaton theory
- Need for comprehensive documentation and examples

## Implementation Approach
The implementation will focus on:
1. Building equivalence classes of states
2. Constructing minimized automatons
3. Efficient state transition computation
4. Integration with AST optimization techniques
