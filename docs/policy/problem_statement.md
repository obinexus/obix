# OBIX Policy System for Component Protection

## Problem Statement

The OBIX framework needs a comprehensive policy system to enable environment-specific security restrictions for both functional and OOP components. This system must integrate with the DOP (Data-Oriented Programming) adapter pattern and automaton state minimization technology to:

1. Enforce access restrictions based on execution environment (development, staging, testing, production)
2. Protect sensitive components handling PII data (bank cards, SSNs, etc.)
3. Support decorator patterns for both class and functional components
4. Allow for policy configuration via IoC (Inversion of Control) containers
5. Provide lifecycle hooks for policy enforcement across all component types
6. Maintain the 1:1 correspondence guarantee between functional and OOP implementations

The policy system will be similar to the C-based PoliC framework in concept, but implemented in TypeScript with specific enhancements for the OBIX web framework.
